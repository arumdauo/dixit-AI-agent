Men used to have expectations of female beauty and behavior, but decades of feminist propaganda have given men the impression that class, manners, femininity, and thin bodies are sexist or misogynistic. Today, a woman can disfigure herself with tattoos and piercings, curse like a sailor, get publicly drunk, cheat, and start fights, yet still be pursued by men who have been trained to think that she is strong and empowered.

6,"Another father has died. What is left behind is just sadness. Broken family and toys. As usual, the murderer is another coldblooded wife, she knows very well that always women who kill get away with murder. Rihanna is saying it very clearly  I just shot a man down, ram pa pa pam I am having fun, just kill all men!!! . Rihanna released a music video that says directly that premeditated murder when it is done against men and fathers is good. And that the justice system is so weak and will not sentence murderes when they are female gender, to where they belong (electrical chair). If a man would have done it, he would be executed. But as long as a woman is the murderer, she always can lie and cry in front of jury, and she goes away and she is released after murdering. Rihanna  Man Down  just another horrible expression of feminism and the generalised hate against men. You can also read  The END OF ALL MEN  book bestseller on Amazon, which expresses generalized hate and tells to people that all men should be exterminated. This is the feminists agenda",,42,0.0,71,0.2,6,0.4,22,0.2,83.0,0.0,8.0,0.2
